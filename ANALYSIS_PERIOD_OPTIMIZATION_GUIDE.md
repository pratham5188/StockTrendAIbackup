## ⚡ **Performance Optimization Tips**

### **For Best Prediction Accuracy:**

#### **1. Model Training Periods**
- **XGBoost**: 6-12 months minimum
- **Prophet**: 12-24 months minimum  
- **Ensemble**: 12 months minimum

#### **2. Validation Strategy**
```python
# Recommended data split
Training Data: 70% (e.g., 8-9 months of 1-year data)
Validation: 15% (e.g., 1.5 months)
Testing: 15% (e.g., 1.5 months)
```

#### **3. Dynamic Period Selection**
```python
# Recommended logic for your app
if prediction_horizon <= 7 days:
    use_period = "3mo"
elif prediction_horizon <= 30 days:
    use_period = "6mo"
elif prediction_horizon <= 90 days:
    use_period = "1y"
else:
    use_period = "2y"
```

)
```

### **Smart Period Selection Logic:**

def get_optimal_period(stock_symbol, prediction_type):
    """Smart period selection based on analysis"""
    
    if prediction_type == "short_term":  # 1-7 days
        return "3mo"
    elif prediction_type == "medium_term":  # 1-4 weeks  
        return "6mo"
    elif prediction_type == "long_term":  # 1-6 months

       st.warning("⚠️ Short periods may reduce prediction accuracy")
   elif period in ['10y', 'max']:
       st.warning("⚠️ Very long periods may include outdated market patterns")
   ```

### **Model-Specific Defaults:**
```python
model_period_recommendations = {
    'xgboost': '1y',      # XGBoost works best with 1 year
    'prophet': '2y',      # Prophet needs longer periods
    'lightgbm': '1y',     # Similar to XGBoost
    'ensemble': '1y'      # Balanced for all models
}
```
